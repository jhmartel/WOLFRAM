WOLFRAM Language in my Research

This repository contains sample code illustrating the applications of WOLFRAM in my research.
The beauty of WOLFRAM lies in it being a symbolic language. It is nearest to the thought processes of a mathematician.
The key to WOLFRAM is, I believe, that it's symbolism makes it excellent in polynomial transformations. All data is represented by polynomials.
For example, a measure μ on a space X can be represented as a polynomial μ = pt[x1]+pt[x2]+pt[x3]+..., etc. That is, we represent a point by the header "pt", and place the space coordinates x1 inside the header, thus pt[x1] represents "a point at x1".

The fundamental operation in WOLFRAM is Find and Replace using pattern matching. [INCOMPLETE]
